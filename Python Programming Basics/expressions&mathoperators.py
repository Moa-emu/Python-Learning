# Python has a vast array of libraries/functions and constructors but we will just be learning enough just o write useful programs.

# Here are some math opperators for you to understand
#  - (**) Exponent Operator ex: 2 ** 3 will evaluate to 8
#  - (%) Modulus/remainder ex: 22 % 8 will evaluate to 6 because the remainder of 22 divided by 8 is 6
#  - (//) interger division  ex: 22 // 8 will evaluate ot 2 because it will give the highest 
print(2 * 2)
