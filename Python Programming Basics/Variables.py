#Variables and how to store values in them
#   - A variable is just a way that you can store a value that you can use later
#   - To assign a value to a variable all you have to do is use the asssignment operator 
#   - example of using the assignment operator: money = 42
#   -You can see in our example that we have a variable we named money and we assigned it to the value of 42
#   - Remember that a variable is initialized/created after you assign it after that you can do whatever you want with it look below
greeting = 'hello'
print(greeting)


money = 12
hours = 12
profit = money * hours
print(profit)
