#this is exercise: 43

# It is common for images of a countryâ€™s previous leaders, or other individuals of historical significance, to appear on its money. The individuals that appear on banknotes
# in the United States are listed in Table 2.1.
# Write a program that begins by reading the denomination of a banknote from the
# user. Then your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the
# banknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message should be displayed
# if no such note exists.

# here is the table:
# George Washington - $1
# Thomas Jefferson - $2
# Abraham Lincoln -$5
# Alexander Hamilton - $10
# Andrew Jackson - $20
# Ulysses S. Grant - $50
# Benjamin Franklin - $100
