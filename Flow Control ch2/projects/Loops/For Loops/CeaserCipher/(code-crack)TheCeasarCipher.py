#read the text file explaining the ceaser Cipher 
# for this project we will be using import statements, constants, for loops, conditions, in and not in and the find string method


#below I am importing pyperclip module
#pyperclip will allow us to use functions like pyperclip.copy()
#pyperclip.copy() will allow us to automatically copy string to your computer's clipboard so that you can convieniently paste them into other programs
import pyperclip # i had to pip install this

#Below will be a constant(variable that does not change) we need it so that it  contains every possible character that can be encrypted with this Caesar cipher. Because that string shouldnâ€™t change, we store it in the constant variable
#Symbol is a common term used in cryptography for a single character that a cipher can encrypt or decrypt. A symbol set is every possible symbol a cipher is set up to encrypt or decrypt.
