You can Hack a Ceaser Cipher by using a cryptanalytic technique called brute-force.
 A brute-force attack tries every possible decryption key for a cipher. Nothing stops a cryptanalyst from guessing
 one key, decrypting the ciphertext with that key, looking at the output, and then moving on to the
 next key if they didn’t find the secret message. Because the brute-force technique is so effective
 against the Caesar cipher, you shouldn’t actually use the Caesar cipher to encrypt secret information.

(Kerckoffs's Principal) - A cipher should still be secure even if everyone knows how the cipher works and someone else has the ciphertext

(Shannon's Maxim) - "The enemy knows the system"
