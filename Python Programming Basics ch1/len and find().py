#below will be a breif explanation of the len function
# The len() function in Python is used to get the length of an object. Here's a brief explanation along with examples:

# For Strings:

# It returns the number of characters in the string.
 
s = "Hello, World!"
print(len(s))  # Output: 13




# The find() method takes one string argument and
# returns the integer index of where the argument appears in the method’s string. Enter the following
# into the interactive shell:
'hello'.find('e')
# output is 1

# The string you pass as an argument to find() can be more than one character. The integer that
# find() returns will be the index of the first character where the argument is found.
'hello'.find('ello')
# output is 1

'hello'.find('lo')
# output is 3

# If the string argument can’t be found, the find() method returns the integer -1.
'hello'.find('x')
#output is -1
