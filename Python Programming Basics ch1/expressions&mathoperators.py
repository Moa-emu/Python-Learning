# Python has a vast array of libraries/functions and constructors but we will just be learning enough just o write useful programs.
# Also the book that we are getting all of this information from is Automate the boring stuff with Python


# Here are some math opperators for you to understand
#  - (**) Exponent Operator ex: 2 ** 3 will evaluate to 8
#  - (%) Modulus/remainder ex: 22 % 8 will evaluate to 6 because the remainder of 22 divided by 8 is 6
#  - (//) interger division  ex: 22 // 8 will evaluate to 2 because it will give the highest floored qoutient
#  - (/) Normal division  ex: 22 / 8 will evaluate to 2.75 because it will give the actual calculated divisio including decimal points
#  - (*) Multiplication  ex: 3 * 5  This will evaluate to 15 just normal multiplication
#  - (-) Subtraction ex: 5 - 2 This will evaluate to 3 because it is just normal subtraction
#  - (+) Addition ex: 2 + 2 Thsi will evaluater to 4 because we are just doing basic additon



# Also Another thing that you should know is that python has it's own precedence just like how in math we have rules like PEMDAS
# IN python the Operation order from first to last is **, *, /, //, %, +, -
# You can overide these operators by using parentheses for example: (2 + 3) * 6 . 2 + 3 is done first then the result is multiplied by 6

# print will just print the output to the console/ terminal
# also we make comments in pyton using # if you could not tell comments are useful for writing notes and explaining how code works

#Below we will print the Exponent operator of 2^3
print(2 ** 3)

# Below we are using the modulus operator
print(48 % 8)

# below we are using the interger floored division operator
print(48 // 8)

#Below we are using the regular division operator which will include the decimal numbers
print(48 / 3)

#Below we are usign the Multiplication operator
print(3 * 3)

#Below we are using the addition operator
print(3 + 3)

#Below we are uising the subtraction operator
print(3 - 3)

# below is an example using parentheis and math operators
print((5 - 1) * ((7 + 1) / (3 - 1)))
