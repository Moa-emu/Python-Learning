#Variables and how to store values in them
#   - A variable is just a way that you can store a value that you can use later
#   - To assign a value to a variable all you have to do is use the asssignment operator 
#   - example of using the assignment operator: money = 42
#   -You can see in our example that we have a variable we named money and we assigned it to the value of 42
#   - Remember that a variable is initialized/created after you assign it after that you can do whatever you want with it look below
greeting = 'hello'
print(greeting)


money = 12
hours = 12
profit = money * hours
print(profit)

# What to remember when Naming your variables
# - make it one word
# - you can use letters, numbers and underscores(_)
# - Do not let it begin with a number
# - Do not let it have any spaces
# - Do not Let it have any hyphens(-)
# - Do not let it have any special characters such as (%, *, $, '') or anything like that 


# Additonal notes on creating variable names make sure that your variable names are descriptive so you can remember what they are being used for
#- also it is a good Idea to use camel casing ex: moneyPerHour  - where the first word is lower case and the rest is capitalized
#- also making variables using uderscores like this is cool to  money_Per_Hour
# - and last but not least variables are case sensitive meaning that money, Money and MONEY are all diffrent variables
