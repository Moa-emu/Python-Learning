# Augmented assignment operators in Python combine the functioning of an arithmetic or bitwise operator with the assignment operator. They provide a shorter way to update the value of a variable based on the result of an operation. Here are some examples of augmented assignment operators:

# Addition and Assignment (+=): Combines addition and assignment. x += y is equivalent to x = x + y.
x =  5
x +=  3  # x is now  8



# Subtraction and Assignment (-=): Combines subtraction and assignment. x -= y is equivalent to x = x - y.
x =  10
x -=  4  # x is now  6



# Multiplication and Assignment (*=): Combines multiplication and assignment. x *= y is equivalent to x = x * y.
x =  7
x *=  2  # x is now  14



# Division and Assignment (/=): Combines division and assignment. x /= y is equivalent to x = x / y.
x =  15
x /=  3  # x is now  5.0



# Floor Division and Assignment (//=): Combines floor division and assignment. x //= y is equivalent to x = x // y.
x =  17
x //=  4  # x is now  4



# Modulus and Assignment (%=): Combines modulus and assignment. x %= y is equivalent to x = x % y.
x =  20
x %=  7  # x is now  6




# Exponentiation and Assignment (=)**: Combines exponentiation and assignment. x **= y is equivalent to x = x ** y.
x =  2
x **=  3  # x is now  8


# Bitwise AND and Assignment (&=): Combines bitwise AND and assignment. x &= y is equivalent to x = x & y.
x =  5
x &=  3  # x is now  1 (binary  0101 &  0011)




# Bitwise OR and Assignment (|=): Combines bitwise OR and assignment. x |= y is equivalent to x = x | y.
x =  5
x |=  3  # x is now  7 (binary  0101 |  0011)




# Bitwise XOR and Assignment (^=): Combines bitwise XOR and assignment. x ^= y is equivalent to x = x ^ y.
x =  5
x ^=  3  # x is now  6 (binary  0101 ^  0011)




# Right Shift and Assignment (>>=): Combines right shift and assignment. x >>= y is equivalent to x = x >> y.
x =  8
x >>=  1  # x is now  4 (binary  1000 >>  1)



# Left Shift and Assignment (<<=): Combines left shift and assignment. x <<= y is equivalent to x = x << y.
x =  4
x <<=  1  # x is now  8 (binary  0100 <<  1)



# These operators are commonly used to update the value of a variable based on a calculation or operation, which can make the code more readable and concise
