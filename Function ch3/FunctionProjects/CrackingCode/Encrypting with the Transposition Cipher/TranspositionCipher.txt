The Caesar cipher isn’t secure; it doesn’t take much for a computer to brute-force through all 66
possible keys. The transposition cipher, on the other hand, is more difficult to brute-force because
the number of possible keys depends on the message’s length. There are many different types of
transposition ciphers, including the rail fence cipher, route cipher, Myszkowski transposition cipher,
and disrupted transposition cipher. This chapter covers a simple transposition cipher called the
columnar transposition cipher.

How the Cipher works:
Instead of substituting characters with other characters, the transposition cipher rearranges the
message’s symbols into an order that makes the original message unreadable. Because each key
creates a different ordering, or permutation, of the characters, a cryptanalyst doesn’t know how to
rearrange the ciphertext back into the original message.
The steps for encrypting with the transposition cipher are as follows:
1. Count the number of characters in the message and the key.
2. Draw a row of a number of boxes equal to the key (for example, 8 boxes for a key of 8).
3. Start filling in the boxes from left to right, entering one character per box.
4. When you run out of boxes but still have more characters, add another row of boxes.
5. When you reach the last character, shade in the unused boxes in the last row.
6. Starting from the top left and going down each column, write out the characters. When you get
to the bottom of a column, move to the next column to the right. Skip any shaded boxes. This
will be the ciphertext.
