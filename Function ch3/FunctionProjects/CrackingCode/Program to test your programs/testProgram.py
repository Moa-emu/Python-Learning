# To ensure the reliability of transposition cipher programs for encryption and decryption, extensive manual testing with various messages and keys can be time-consuming and tedious. Instead, an automated testing program can be written to generate random messages and keys, which are then encrypted and decrypted using the cipher programs. Automated testing allows for the rapid execution of numerous combinations, confirming the functionality of the encryption and decryption processes

#I also made some copies I did of the encrypt and decrypt programs that I made
