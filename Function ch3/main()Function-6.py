# The main() function in Python is a convention followed by Python developers to indicate the entry point of a script or application. Although Python does not require a main() function it is considered good practice to define one.

#Reasons to have a main() function:
# 1.)Entry Point: The main() function acts as the entry point of the script. It is where the program starts executing.
# 2.)Code Organization: By encapsulating the main logic of your program in a main() function, you can keep the code organized and maintainable. It also makes it clear to other developers where the main execution path begins.
# 3.)Conditional Execution: Python uses the __name__ attribute to determine whether a script is being run directly or imported as a module. By checking if __name__ == "__main__" before calling main(), you ensure that the main() function is only executed when the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module

# Here's an example of how main() is typically used in a Python script:

def main():
    # Your code here
    pass#pass is just a placeholder until the actual code is implemented

if __name__ == "__main__":#if you replace"__main__" with another library/file then the code in the main function will only run in that other library/file
    #call the main function
    main()
# In this pattern:
# The main() function contains the core logic of your program.
# The if __name__ == "__main__": check ensures that main() is only called when the script is run directly. If the script is imported as a module in another script, the main() function will not be called
#Here is another simplified reason
