#This is Exercise 121

# Pythonâ€™s standard library includes a method named count that determines how
# many times a specific value occurs in a list. In this exercise, you will create a new
# function named countRange which determines and returns the number of elements
# within a list that are greater than or equal to some minimum value and less than some
# maximum value. Your function will take three parameters: the list, the minimum
# value and the maximum value. It will return an integer result greater than or equal to
# 0. Include a main program that demonstrates your function for several different lists,
# minimum values and maximum values. Ensure that your program works correctly
# for both lists of integers and lists of floating point numbers.
