# This is exercise 119


# In many card games each player is dealt a specific number of cards after the deck
# has been shuffled. Write a function, deal, which takes the number of hands, the
# number of cards per hand, and a deck of cards as its three parameters. Your function
# should return a list containing all of the hands that were dealt. Each hand will be
# represented as a list of cards.
# When dealing the hands, your function should modify the deck of cards passed
# to it as a parameter, removing each card from the deck as it is added to a playerâ€™s
# hand. When cards are dealt, it is customary to give each player a card before any
# player receives an additional card. Your function should follow this custom when
# constructing the hands for the players.
# Use your solution to Exercise 118 to help you construct a main program that
# creates and shuffles a deck of cards, and then deals out four hands of five cards each.
# Display all of the hands of cards, along with the cards remaining in the deck after
# the hands have been dealt.
